	lyric:'You know what?
It's never too late to fly
To places you dream of
To the ones you love
Are you ready?
Fly for love with me
Let's go
I can't believe one day
I can go to Tokyo
Looking good in Kimono
Try the yummy bento
Feel the sakura
Getting lost in Shinjuku
People keep asking:
"Are you from Harajuku?"
I can't believe one day
I can go to Seoul
Getting close to my idol
"Oppa Saranghaeyo"
Take a snap snap
Of the kimchi and the bibimbap
Come to Itaewon
Try the soju with the popcorn
Flying everywhere
Everywhere I wish I could
Live on the airplane
We're so hight
I feel so happy happy happy
It's lovely lovely lovely
And I'm lucky lucky to go
Around the world with you
All the yummy yummy yummy food
Oh they taste so good
Vietjet, thank you for the connection
Because right now we're flying for love
Flying for love
Flying, flying for love
Around around the world
We are flying for love
Yeah, Flying for love
Flying, flying for love
Around around the world
We are flying for love
No more waiting day by day
I will travel to Taipei
With a handful of satay
Making my own way
From the streets of Ximen
To the very peaceful jiuten
Drinking bubble milk tea
Felling care-free
Bangkok is for all the family
Everything shining and gold
But never feel so old
When you get here
Learn to say "Sawadee kha"
They will look you in the eye
With a big best smile
Flying everywhere
Everywhere I wish I could
Live on the airplane
We're so hight
I feel so happy happy happy
It's lovely lovely lovely
And I'm lucky lucky to go
Around the world with you
All the yummy yummy yummy food
Oh they taste so good
Vietjet, thank you for the connection
Because right now we're flying for love
Flying for love
Flying, flying for love
Around around the world
We are flying for love
Yeah, Flying for love
Flying, flying for love
Around around the world
We are flying for love
